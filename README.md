 I embarked on my journey as an inexperienced electrical electronics student. As time progressed, I came to the realization that my true passion lay within the realm of gaming. After graduating from university, I decided to elevate my childhood interest in games to a more serious pursuit and delved into the world of game development. I began this exciting path by diving into Unity and learning C#. My enthusiasm for acquiring comprehensive knowledge about the game development universe continues to drive me forward.
