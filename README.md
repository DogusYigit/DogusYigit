 <summary><h3>ğŸ’¿ Coding Journey</h3></summary>
 I started my journey as a naive electrical electronics student. As time passed, I realized that my main interest was in the game world. I took my interest in games from an early age to the next level after I graduated from university and became interested in game development. On this path that I started with Unity and C#, I am passionate about learning everything I can about the world of game development.
